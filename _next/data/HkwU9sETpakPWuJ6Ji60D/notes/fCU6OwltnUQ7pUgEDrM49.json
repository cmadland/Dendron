Findings suggest that social media has the potential to positively impact learner engagement with instructional support and when it is elevated from merely an entertainment source to a productive source for connected learning. This includes uses for communication as well as creative expression within and beyond the class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Global market research suggests that social media use remains one of the most popular online activities around the world, with worldwide adoption reportedly estimated at 4.2 billion users (DataReportal, 2021), representing approximately 54% of the world population. In the United States, traditional college-age students are using social media now more than ever. According to the Pew Research Center (2019), approximately 70% of American adults use at least one social media platform for interpersonal connections, access to news content, sharing information, and entertainment, with the highest use among young adults in the 18–29-year-old age range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dabbagh and Kitsantas (2012) broadly define social media as \"a variety of networked tools or technologies that emphasize the social aspects of the Internet as a channel for communication, collaboration, and creative expression\" (p. 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As these technologies continue to proliferate, many college students are actively involved in participatory cultures (Jenkins, 2009) </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"p138\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p138\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p138</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This phenomenological study investigated the lived experience of engagement when using social media as a learning resource during an online college course. The purpose of this research is to help online instructors and designers in higher education better understand how learners experience engagement when learning online with social media. Connected learning served as a conceptual framework to critically analyze meaningful connections within the learning experience and to address the following research questions: What is it like to experience engagement when using social media for learning in an online college course? And how do various elements of learning with social media influence learners’ feelings of engagement?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To maximize learner engagement, more open conceptions of learning must be considered. The ubiquity of technology is now shaping learning as mobile, open, and networked. Learning is not just confined to classrooms or formal education programs. Rather, it is an everyday occurrence that happens lifelong and life wide, formally and informally, both inside and outside of school. So it must be framed as much more fluid than traditional, formal conceptions of education often imply. The connected learning framework has been proposed in seminal research by Ito et al.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"p139\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p139\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p139</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(2013) as a learning, design, and technology model based on such open, inclusive, and fluid conceptions of learning. It focuses on illuminating diverse learning pathways that move across formal and informal settings to transform the very nature of learning, including what it means, how it is defined, how it occurs, and where it takes place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Connected learning environments weave together learning activities that are interest-driven, peer-supported, and academically oriented (Ito et al., 2013). Thus, connected learning experiences prioritize and leverage learners’ personal interests and peer networks as a means to open up new opportunities for learning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"research-findings\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#research-findings\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Research Findings</h2>\n<h3 id=\"p142\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p142\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p142</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to participant narratives drawn from interviews, reflection blog postings, emails, and other digital artifacts generated for class activities, engagement in social media feels focused, purposeful, and self-driven. It often develops naturally as students gain more comfort and familiarity with this method of learning and the use of different platforms. When using social media in an online course, it doesn’t usually feel engaging right away and can actually feel stressful and unfamiliar. Participants often commented that they initially experienced some tension and discomfort with this new approach to learning online. Early in their experience they remarked that they preferred to use learning strategies like discussion forums in a traditional Learning Management System because this medium was often used in their previous online courses. However, for every participant, engagement evolved over time as more familiarity was established and comfort was developed. It continued to heighten as the course went along and as they discovered new ways of communicating and participating with it through interactions with the instructor and classmates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"p143\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p143\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p143</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Findings also suggest that engagement when learning with social media may also feel creative, unique, and artistic. This was also framed by participants as a personal rather than a social attribute, especially in class activities when social media was used for more than just relaying or sharing information. When students were encouraged to create something new like a web page or infographic using Adobe Spark based on a course topic, this was perceived to be much more engaging and meaningful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Participants also indicated that formal requirements for class activities, including rubrics or exact specifications for a task or project, often felt limiting, forced, and even intimidating, which diminished feelings of engagement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for some class projects students were able to pursue a topic related to their own interests and create a digital artifact of their choice (e.g., a web page, video, or blog post) to demonstrate their understanding and skills. However, some participants also indicated that more freedom to make choices about what they wanted to do or how they could do it sometimes also felt very overwhelming and intimidating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was also disengaging when there was too much information or too many things to read and respond to. In these situations, participants often weren’t sure how to wade through and make sense of an overabundance of resources. They stated that instructor guidance and help in these instances was necessary and beneficial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In summary, findings indicate that social media has the potential to positively impact learner engagement when integrated with connected learning principles and supported with pedagogical guidance. For example, instructor modeling and examples created by the instructor and shared with students were especially helpful in demonstrating how particular social media tools can be used for communication, collaboration, and creativity. Nearly all participants described the important influence of these supportive design elements, especially early in the course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"implications\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#implications\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Implications</h2>\n<h3 id=\"p144\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p144\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p144</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The findings of this study suggest that the use of social media for learning in online college courses has the potential to be more engaging and connections are more meaningful when social media use is elevated to be a source for interaction among classmates, leveraging personal interests, sharing new ideas, and creative expression within and beyond the class.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>More research in this area is necessary, but these findings support that intentionally integrating social media using connected learning principles may also be valuable in establishing coherence between where and how people interact, communicate, and learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The study also supports a call for a re-envisioning of what online course designs can include beyond traditional conventions and to illustrate how meaningful it may be to open up possibilities for the potential that social media holds for learning, both during a formal course and beyond.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"commentary\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#commentary\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Commentary</h2>\n<p>Pazurek (2021) engaged in a phenomenological exploration of the lived experiences of learners taking an undergraduate course on social media and connected learning.
