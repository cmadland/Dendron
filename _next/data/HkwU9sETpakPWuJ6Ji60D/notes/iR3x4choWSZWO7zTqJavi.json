Springer, Cham. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>catalysed at the 2017 symposium at the Centre for Research on Assessment and Digital LEarning (CRADLE)</li>\n<li>challenge to 'fundamentally re-imagine the intersection of assessment and digital learning in higher education.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the authors in this book take a range of views about assessment and focus on various purposes or aspects, these align with the broadest view: assessment as making judgements about what someone is capable of, based on some sort of demonstration or product</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The digital world offers a range of technologies that can enable us to do things we’ve always wanted to do with assessment at a massive scale. It also enables us to assess differently, or make sense of masses of data to understand the efficacy of existing approaches.\nThe digital world also poses fundamental challenges not just to how we assess, but to what we assess.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Assessment in a digital world is thus a broader concept than the narrower concept of ‘e-assessment’ that tends to occupy the intersection between technology and assessment. E-assessment is largely concerned with technologized assessment, and at its best it leverages what new technologies can do to enable new forms of assessment that are better for learning and judging what students can do. While there is benefit in making assessment digital, we think that there are much greater opportunities and challenges posed by the digital world for assessment. Some of these may not even involve technologized assessment at all; instead they may involve preparing learners for tasks that are distinctly human. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"color-tag\" style=\"--tag-color: #01c08d;\" href=\"/Dendron/notes/YKMyA6FY1Za2J0ArEqGmU\">Digital</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"5jYEnrzN6hGFE8UIGFZmq","title":"Literature","desc":"","updated":1641603128996,"created":1640807033123,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"50d4df57e1d51dc7dc70adcb1107174a","links":[],"anchors":{"colin-madland":{"type":"header","text":"Colin Madland","value":"colin-madland","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"lookup":{"type":"header","text":"Lookup","value":"lookup","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["B7myY49HkkF7myZxUuBxl","L22lROYOyWkZEdDIPsTID","yTIqwRe5IPrxiJ01mdsxI","LoO5XTqa9xfDY8xhh161H","jADP0D1g2XDXGy7YK6hfq","VpmPuvmeSOhFST1BB6QTT"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Colin Madland\n\nUsing this site to build a networked literature repository\n## Lookup\n\nThis section contains useful links to related resources.\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](https://link.dendron.so/6b25)\n- [Discord](https://link.dendron.so/6b23)\n- [Home Page](https://wiki.dendron.so/)\n- [Github](https://link.dendron.so/6b24)\n- [Developer Docs](https://docs.dendron.so/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":4,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Dendron","siteUrl":"https://cmadland.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space","siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false}}},"__N_SSG":true}
