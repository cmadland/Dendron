It tends therefore to reflect the needs and concerns of a previous time. However, this does not align with a digitally enabled world with rapidly expanding information and an increasingly dynamic view of knowledge. This chapter explores how to reimagine assessment in a time of digital change. Firstly, it investigates how assessment designs can draw on technology to move beyond the status quo, providing an example of a programmatic e-portfolio. Next, it introduces the idea that assessments should enable graduates to work in the digital world. This is discussed through an illustration of how students can build effective digital personas, including social media profiles, within their assessments. Finally, it looks to the inter-relationship between assessment and knowledge in a digital world, suggesting co-construction as a guiding principle. Often assessment is overlooked in discussions of educational technology. Reimagining university assessment is a key way to make teaching and learning applicable to a digital world.</p>\n<h2 id=\"p7\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p7\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p7</h2>\n<h2 id=\"introduction\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#introduction\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Introduction</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Traditions cast long shadows. No matter when you were educated, you would find many aspects of today’s typical university assessments familiar, if not identical, to those held within your alma mater.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"p8\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p8\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p8</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So it remains curious that even though universities may use digital technologies to conduct assessment, it is often in the same form as in previous generations, albeit more efficiently, at distance and at scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The digital technologies that underlie these changes have much to offer university assessment. However, as described, traditions are remarkably persistent and new tools have tended to reinforce the same educational practices (- Selwyn 2014, 2016).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Selwyn, N. (2014). Digital technology and the contemporary university: Degrees of digitization. London: Routledge.</li>\n<li>Selwyn, N. (2016). Is technology good for education? Cambridge: Polity.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The dominant modes of university assessment remain much as they were: demonstrations of knowledge, such as quizzes, tests or essays, which can be easily compared and graded. In a time where it is easy to access information rapidly and accurately, our assessments appear to be somewhat missing the point. They too often require a high degree of recall and offer little opportunity for student input or choice. Our overall impression is, in higher education, the digital has locked in an old set of ideas about assessment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, there is little discussion regarding how these contemporary views of assessment can mesh with the now ubiquitous digital technologies, educational or otherwise. Assessment is often overlooked in educational technology conversations despite its pivotal role within the academy. As we explore later, institutions and educators reveal their values both by what is assessed and how (Knight 1995). We suggest that significant questions remain largely unaddressed: How can technology support forms of assessment that emphasise learning? How can assessments support living and working in a digital era, with its networked and rapid access to both people and information?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"p9\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p9\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p9</h2>\n<h2 id=\"the-need-to-reimagine\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#the-need-to-reimagine\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>The Need to Reimagine</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, higher education cannot avoid digital technologies, irrespective of whether deliberate attempts to harness technology to improve education are successful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his 2014 book, Digital Technology and the Contemporary University: Degrees of Digitisation, Selwyn interrogates the current status of technology within the university. He writes: “the pessimistic commentator [accepts] that digital technology is not bringing about the changes and transformations that many people contend…” (p. 18). He calls for “the very difficult conversations that need to take place about what digital higher education is, and what digital higher education should be.” From Selwyn’s perspective, technology is not neutral: it serves a variety of different and often competing agendas. He notes, as we have, that digital technologies tend to maintain the status quo. Most of the book dissects the often grim realities of digital technologies in our universities and outlines a range of ways in which administrative and educational technologies “reproduce long-standing and deep-rooted structures and arrangements” (p. 141). However, in closing, Selwyn suggests we need to reimagine higher education in this digital era. He calls for changes in how we talk about educational technology, the physical spaces surrounding technologies, and the need for guiding principles which outline moral rules of engagement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second scholarly work of interest is Barnett and Bengtsen’s 2017 paper: Universities and Epistemology: From a Dissolution of Knowledge to the Emergence of a New Thinking. In contrast to Selwyn’s pessimistic stance, the authors “argue that an optimistic university is a university-in-the-world and thinks the future from the world.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"p10\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#p10\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>p10</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the very notions of truth and knowledge have changed, then this necessarily impacts upon institutions whose core purpose is knowledge production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"reimagining-the-status-quo\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#reimagining-the-status-quo\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Reimagining the Status Quo</h2>","noteIndex":{"id":"5jYEnrzN6hGFE8UIGFZmq","title":"Literature","desc":"","updated":1641603128996,"created":1640807033123,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"50d4df57e1d51dc7dc70adcb1107174a","links":[],"anchors":{"colin-madland":{"type":"header","text":"Colin Madland","value":"colin-madland","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"lookup":{"type":"header","text":"Lookup","value":"lookup","line":10,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["B7myY49HkkF7myZxUuBxl","L22lROYOyWkZEdDIPsTID","yTIqwRe5IPrxiJ01mdsxI","LoO5XTqa9xfDY8xhh161H","jADP0D1g2XDXGy7YK6hfq","VpmPuvmeSOhFST1BB6QTT"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Colin Madland\n\nUsing this site to build a networked literature repository\n## Lookup\n\nThis section contains useful links to related resources.\n\n- [Getting Started Guide](https://link.dendron.so/6b25)\n- [Discord](https://link.dendron.so/6b23)\n- [Home Page](https://wiki.dendron.so/)\n- [Github](https://link.dendron.so/6b24)\n- [Developer Docs](https://docs.dendron.so/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":4,"useFMTitle":true,"useNoteTitleForLink":true,"mermaid":true,"useKatex":true,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"site":{"assetsPrefix":"/Dendron","siteUrl":"https://cmadland.github.io","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"siteRootDir":"docs","usePrettyRefs":true,"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space","siteLastModified":true,"gh_edit_branch":"main","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"usePrettyLinks":true,"siteNotesDir":"notes","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","gh_edit_link":true,"gh_edit_link_text":"Edit this page on GitHub","gh_root":"docs/","gh_edit_view_mode":"edit","writeStubs":true,"siteIndex":"root"},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"randomNote":{},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false}}},"__N_SSG":true}
