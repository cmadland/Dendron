Where does the proposal break off into 3 studies? at the RQ level? purpose?</h3>
<ul>
<li>2-papers for candidacy over a month, very general questions.</li>
<li>one theoretical and one methodological</li>
<li>M ended up collecting data, and completing the studies, then writing a proposal for which papers to include in the diss</li>
<li>defended proposal very late in the process</li>
<li>proposal was an overview, not much lit b/c it was covered in candidacy papers, rather built from candidacy papers</li>
<li>3 papers built off each other so harder to write a specific proposal for 2nd and 3rd paper</li>
<li>dissertation was a shortened version of candidacies, tightened</li>
<li>summarized implications</li>
<li>main idea is to create a meta-leve proposal</li>
<li>studies can be RQ</li>
<li>could be MM over-arching design, lots of variation</li>
<li>proposal should be overarching methods for all three</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>M did it consecutive</li>
<li>1st was theoretical, submitted to J</li>
<li>2nd, was big idea, but they didn't know how it worked in the classroom, qualitative exploration</li>
<li>once those were established, 3rd was more quantitative. </li>
<li>all three were consecutive</li>
<li>if you have to do them consecutively, they can take a long time</li>
<li>could be that you do them concurrently</li>
<li>no real guidleines</li>

<ul>
<li>U of Oulu; 5-7 papers</li>
<li>questions around a big idea, less tightly connected</li>
<li>papers have to conceptually contribute to the ideas</li>

<ul>
<li>there needs to be something holding it all together</li>
<li>no hard and fast set of guidelines</li>
<li>big theoretical and methodological sections</li>

<h3 id="which-version"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#which-version"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Which version?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>permission from journal to use pre-pub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tricky, one was in submission during the process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M withheld a paper from UVic for a year to see where it would go...problem if the paper changes while under review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no time to think about copyright and publications elsewhere...last screen in dissertation submission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>required to have one accepted for publication and all submitted at time of defense</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>yes, definitely</li>
<li>missed out on longest lit review ever in monograph</li>
<li>more practical skills</li>
<li>writing a monograph is different from writing for a journal</li>
<li>once you submit, you get lots of honest feedbackÂ from peer review</li>
<li>3 things to publish rather than a monograph</li>
<li>better prepared for SSHRC grant</li>
<li>able to think across bigger research project with smaller components</li>

<ul>
<li>it can with revisions and esp if consecutive</li>
<li>hard to judge as m was working full time</li>
<li>Proposal to defense was [edited out]</li>

<ul>
<li>1st paper was theoretical</li>
<li>2nd was in Finland under existing ethics</li>
<li>3rd was under existing ethics at UVic</li>
<li>so no ethics for diss</li>

<ul>
<li>not as in-depth as for a monograph</li>
<li>challenging to work with other universities</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>wide variety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 topics/papers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>summarized the papers, then main findings, biggest findings across all three papers, typical journal article structure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>M's proposal was very specific b/c she had done so much ahead of time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>difficult to squish 3-paper diss into template (3 journal articles all have different running heads...)</p>
</li>
