### FAQ

- Do papers need to be published?
  - no, they need to be publishable, although publication is *prima facie* evidence of publishability
- co-authorship?
  - must be substantially the learner's work, so first author
- Lit review?
  - format involves jettisoning conventional ideas, such as a 'lit review' chapter
  - each article contains a lit review, but of an appropriate length for a journal article
  - that said, some people have included a lit review chapter
