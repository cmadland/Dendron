<p>Assessment exists within a series of pedagogical, administrative and technological legacy practices. It tends therefore to reflect the needs and concerns of a previous time. However, this does not align with a digitally enabled world with rapidly expanding information and an increasingly dynamic view of knowledge. This chapter explores how to reimagine assessment in a time of digital change. Firstly, it investigates how assessment designs can draw on technology to move beyond the status quo, providing an example of a programmatic e-portfolio. Next, it introduces the idea that assessments should enable graduates to work in the digital world. This is discussed through an illustration of how students can build effective digital personas, including social media profiles, within their assessments. Finally, it looks to the inter-relationship between assessment and knowledge in a digital world, suggesting co-construction as a guiding principle. Often assessment is overlooked in discussions of educational technology. Reimagining university assessment is a key way to make teaching and learning applicable to a digital world.</p>

<p>So it remains curious that even though universities may use digital technologies to conduct assessment, it is often in the same form as in previous generations, albeit more efficiently, at distance and at scale.</p>

<p>The digital technologies that underlie these changes have much to offer university assessment. However, as described, traditions are remarkably persistent and new tools have tended to reinforce the same educational practices (- Selwyn 2014, 2016).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, higher education cannot avoid digital technologies, irrespective of whether deliberate attempts to harness technology to improve education are successful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In his 2014 book, Digital Technology and the Contemporary University: Degrees of Digitisation, Selwyn interrogates the current status of technology within the university. He writes: “the pessimistic commentator [accepts] that digital technology is not bringing about the changes and transformations that many people contend…” (p. 18). He calls for “the very difficult conversations that need to take place about what digital higher education is, and what digital higher education should be.” From Selwyn’s perspective, technology is not neutral: it serves a variety of different and often competing agendas. He notes, as we have, that digital technologies tend to maintain the status quo. Most of the book dissects the often grim realities of digital technologies in our universities and outlines a range of ways in which administrative and educational technologies “reproduce long-standing and deep-rooted structures and arrangements” (p. 141). However, in closing, Selwyn suggests we need to reimagine higher education in this digital era. He calls for changes in how we talk about educational technology, the physical spaces surrounding technologies, and the need for guiding principles which outline moral rules of engagement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The second scholarly work of interest is Barnett and Bengtsen’s 2017 paper: Universities and Epistemology: From a Dissolution of Knowledge to the Emergence of a New Thinking. In contrast to Selwyn’s pessimistic stance, the authors “argue that an optimistic university is a university-in-the-world and thinks the future from the world.”</p>
