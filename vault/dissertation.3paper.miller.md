### How do you write the proposal? Where does the proposal break off into 3 studies? at the RQ level? purpose?
- 2-papers for candidacy over a month, very general questions.
- one theoretical and one methodological
- M ended up collecting data, and completing the studies, then writing a proposal for which papers to include in the diss
- defended proposal very late in the process
- proposal was an overview, not much lit b/c it was covered in candidacy papers, rather built from candidacy papers
- 3 papers built off each other so harder to write a specific proposal for 2nd and 3rd paper
- dissertation was a shortened version of candidacies, tightened
- summarized implications
- main idea is to create a meta-leve proposal
- studies can be RQ
- could be MM over-arching design, lots of variation
- proposal should be overarching methods for all three

### Concurrent? Consecutive? Rules or guidelines?
- M did it consecutive
- 1st was theoretical, submitted to J
- 2nd, was big idea, but they didn't know how it worked in the classroom, qualitative exploration
- once those were established, 3rd was more quantitative. 
- all three were consecutive
- if you have to do them consecutively, they can take a long time
- could be that you do them concurrently
- no real guidleines

- U of Oulu; 5-7 papers
- questions around a big idea, less tightly connected
- papers have to conceptually contribute to the ideas

### Seems that the guiding principle should be around the Problem
- there needs to be something holding it all together
- no hard and fast set of guidelines
- big theoretical and methodological sections

### Which version?
- permission from journal to use pre-pub
- tricky, one was in submission during the process
- M withheld a paper from UVic for a year to see where it would go...problem if the paper changes while under review.
- no time to think about copyright and publications elsewhere...last screen in dissertation submission

- required to have one accepted for publication and all submitted at time of defense

### Would you do it again?
- yes, definitely
- missed out on longest lit review ever in monograph
- more practical skills
- writing a monograph is different from writing for a journal
- once you submit, you get lots of honest feedback from peer review
- 3 things to publish rather than a monograph
- better prepared for SSHRC grant
- able to think across bigger research project with smaller components

### Take longer
- it can with revisions and esp if consecutive
- hard to judge as m was working full time
- Proposal to defense was [edited out]

### 3 ethics apps?
- 1st paper was theoretical
- 2nd was in Finland under existing ethics
- 3rd was under existing ethics at UVic
- so no ethics for diss

### Lit review?
- not as in-depth as for a monograph
- challenging to work with other universities

### Writing final analysis? create overarching paper?
- wide variety
- 3 topics/papers
- summarized the papers, then main findings, biggest findings across all three papers, typical journal article structure

- M's proposal was very specific b/c she had done so much ahead of time
- difficult to squish 3-paper diss into template (3 journal articles all have different running heads...)
-
