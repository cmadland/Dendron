## Abstract
This study examines the views of assessment of programme directors at a Portuguese public university (n = 60). Data were collected through a questionnaire which included closed and open-ended questions. The participants hold different professional categories and come from medical and health sciences, exact sciences, engineering and technology, social sciences and humanities. Data suggest the use of a variety of assessment methods, through a mix of learner-centred and traditional methods. The year of study, the type of course, the nature of the programmes and the institutional regulations were identified by the programme directors as factors that may influence the selection of the assessment methods. The participants considered assessment practices to be in general adequate, but there is room for improvement, namely through an integrated and interdisciplinary approach.
